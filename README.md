# Axon Syntax Highlighting

A Visual Studio Code extension which provides syntax highlighting for the Axon programming language.
The Axon programming language is a part of SkyFoundry LLC's "SkySpark" software for building analytics.

Highlighting gets applied in .axon and .trio files.

Pull requests welcome.

## Known Issues

* Adding a unit of measurement to a literal will stop it from being recognised as a literal.
* Syntax highlighting gets applied to non-Axon text within .trio files
